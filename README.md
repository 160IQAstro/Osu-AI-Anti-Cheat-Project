# Osu-AI-Anti-Cheat-Project

Welcome to the Osu-AI-Anti-Cheat Project!

Our goal is to train an AI model (using BERT, known for its bi-directional tokenization) to analyze Osu! replays and catch cheaters with a high degree of accuracy.

How You Can Contribute: 

    Submit Replays: Help us improve our model by submitting both cheated and non-cheated replays on our Discord server.
    Join our Discord: https://discord.gg/W4euVvjFKd

    Contribute to the Codebase: If you're a developer, your contributions to our codebase would be greatly appreciated.
   
By participating, you'll be playing a crucial role in making Osu! a fairer and more enjoyable game for everyone. Thank you for your support!

Code will be uploaded as soon as its confirmed to be stable if you want to contribute now DM me on discord
